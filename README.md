# Project Background
IDX-MES BUMN 17 is a collaboration between the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and the Islamic Economic Society (MES). This index comprises 17 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and their affiliates that operate in compliance with Sharia principles. These companies are characterized by high liquidity, large market capitalization, and strong fundamentals.

The primary challenge in stock market investment, including sharia-compliant stocks, lies in determining the optimal allocation of funds to maximize returns while minimizing risks. With the growing interest in sharia-based investments in Indonesia, an effective portfolio management strategy is essential to help investors reduce risks and enhance profitability.

This project aims to optimize the sharia investment portfolio for 5 companies listed on the IDX-MES BUMN 17 index during the period from December 2022 to May 2023. The optimization is carried out using the Mean-Variance Optimization approach, solved through the Steepest Descent method.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
* **Expected Returns and Risk Analysis**: Evaluation of the portfolio's potential returns and associated risks, providing insights into the trade-off between profit and risk for investors in 5 companies listed on the IDX-MES BUMN 17 index.
* **Optimal Capital Allocation**: Recommendations on the percentage of capital allocation for each stock in the portfolio to achieve the best balance between maximizing returns and minimizing risks.

# The Data
The data used in this project consists of the daily closing prices of five companies listed on the IDX-MES BUMN17 index for the period from December 2022 to May 23, 2023. The data, obtained from the Indonesia Stock Exchange and sourced from the website www.yahoofinance.com, includes the following companies: PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (ANTM.JK), PT Elnusa Tbk (ELSA.JK), PT Indonesia Kendaraan Terminal Tbk (IPCC.JK), PT Jasa Armada Indonesia Tbk (IPCM.JK), and PT Kimia Farma Tbk (KAEF.JK).

# Summary
The Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) model was used to minimize investment risk in this portfolio. The Steepest Descent method was employed as a tool to minimize risk and maximize returns. 

**Recommendation:**

With an assumed investment return of 0.02%, and utilizing MATLAB software, the optimal stock investment allocation was determined as follows: 
* 12.70% for PT Aneka Tambang Tbk
* 8.70% for PT Elnusa Tbk
* 10.20% for PT Indonesia Kendaraan Terminal Tbk
* 67.20% for PT Jasa Armada Indonesia Tbk
* 1.20% for PT Kimia Farma Tbk

This allocation resulted in a minimum risk of 0.004%.
