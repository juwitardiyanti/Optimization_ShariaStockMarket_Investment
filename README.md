# Project Background
IDX-MES BUMN 17 is a collaboration between the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and the Islamic Economic Society (MES). This index comprises 17 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and their affiliates that operate in compliance with Sharia principles. These companies are characterized by high liquidity, large market capitalization, and strong fundamentals.
The primary challenge in stock market investment, including sharia-compliant stocks, lies in determining the optimal allocation of funds to maximize returns while minimizing risks. With the growing interest in sharia-based investments in Indonesia, an effective portfolio management strategy is essential to help investors reduce risks and enhance profitability.
This project aims to optimize the sharia investment portfolio for 5 companies listed on the IDX-MES BUMN 17 index during the period from December 2022 to May 2023. The optimization is carried out using the Mean-Variance Optimization approach, solved through the Steepest Descent method.
